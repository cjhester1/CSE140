\f0\fs24 \cf0 	For my testing strategy, I simply googled a bunch of mips instructions that were ready for testing. I then downloaded the MARS MIPS simulator to assemble these instructions and then dumped them to my project file. To test them in my project file I had to edit the scheme of my executable file inside of xcode to assume these new arguments. I wanted to add different types of instructions to see if my Miniature mars could handle the requirements specified in the project.}
